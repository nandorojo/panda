## Static settings
The static settings concert "non-dynamic" editors of the overall screen.

The static settings at the moment include General Preferences, Collor Pallet, and Typography.

These static settings all dictate something general for the project, such as its fonts, color scheme, font sizes, etc. Deck settings and card settings, if specified, override static settings.

For instance, if the Collor pallet specifies `#533592` as the primary color, then the `.zign .button` will use this property.

However, if a given card has a specified color, the CSS will be overridden: `#card-12-Display` will have its own background color.

As always, this cascading form of hierarchy will be followed in the CSS output.

It is not necessary to specify any settings beyond the static ones, but users still have the ability do to so.

## Retrieving static settings

In our default app.js file, each static setting is specified to have its initial array of empty values. That is, the General Preferences array is simply `[]`.

Each array is within a json-like tree for simplicity.

Upon initializing and document ready, our javascript will check to see if there is a `localstorage` object for saved settings. If there is, it will use its values accordingly.


## Saving static settings
*Note: In the future, the method of saving will likely use nodeJS and MongoDB, for a better UX and less bloated load. However, at the time of writing this, we'll be using strictly client-side code.*

Whenever someone changes a static setting, a `function` will be called to update the browser's `localstorage`.

Every single setting will be saved into the json structure. The method of doing so 

Each general setting has its own array containing its settings. By default, on page load, it uses what is specified in general HTML. The exported CSS code when someone decides `.export` a project will reflect the current styles.



## Cards
Cards are elements that are added within decks. Similar to decks, they are made from an initial template and can be edited (their text can be editied, at times images, etc.)

When you add a new `deck` to your `Page Editor`, it contains `Deck Settings`, which edit the general settings of the deck (its background color, etc.) It also contains cards, which can be added or removed. 

Different decks carry different card types, depending on their outline.

Cards differ from decks in that they are not entirely modular â€“ this means that the elements inside of a card template cannot be added or removed.

**For example:** the `Hero with text overlay` deck has a few cards by default: a `header`, a `subtitle` and two `buttons`. These cards can be added, removed, or re-ordered. 

The fields within the cards themselves, however, cannot be removed. Why, you ask? Say you generate a `button` card. It needs to have text and a link, so you aren't able to remove those fields from its template.

### Card Docs
Since theCoderrr is written in HTML, we structure our templates using html attributes. Card editors, templates and displays are all defined based on different attributes.

#### Custom attributes

| attribute | type 				| values      | description
----------- | --------------- | ----------- | -----------
*These will be added later on.*

#### CSS attributes

| value     | type 				| description
----------- | --------------- | -----------
`card-Editor` | class | This class indicates that the given element has fields that edit a given card.
`card-Display` | class | This class indicates that the given element displays content from the corresponding `card-Editor`.
`card-XY-Editor` | id | A unique ID given to the editor of each card. The `X` represents the unique ID # of the card's parent deck. In Javascript, X is equal to the `$deckIndex` variable when the deck is created. The `Y` represents this card's index # among other cards within its parent deck.
`card-XY-Display` | id | A unique ID given to the visible of each card. The X and Y correspond to the above.

#### Global javascript cardvariables

`cardId` | dynamic generator | `cardIndex`, `e`, `currentDeckIndex` | This function generates the unique ID for each card, whether it be Display or Editor. It uses the `cardIndex` argument, generated from its parent functions for-loop, indicating the card index relative to the deck parent. currentDeckIndex is simply meant to pass the current value of the global`$deckIndex` variable. **`cardId()`** is called upon a for-loop of each `card` within the **`deckGenerator()`** function.
